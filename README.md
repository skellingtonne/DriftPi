# DriftPi
A python script to control an RC Car using a RaspberryPi3 + Arduino zero + ps4 Controller. One mass dump as was done in a class 2 years ago

The Basics:

The RC Car was broken and was left for years in the tech office of our school. During the term we were told we would need to use a raspberry pi3 to make a robotic platform move. We ended up not wanting to do that and opted for moding the old RC car

The raspberry pi's role was overkill and it was a glorified reciever and speaker for sound effects.

The zero's role was to steer, again overkill but we used the old stepper motor that was still working on the front end and had the raspberry pi tell it when to turn.

Only having a couple weeks + exam studying going on it ended up working, wouldn't recommend the spaghetti western code that I wrote for the controller but it worked.
